# DM Environment Indicator

Add a colour coded indicator to the WordPress admin bar to indicate which environment we're in (local development/staging/live).

It is designed to be used with our [WordPress layout](https://github.com/DeliciousMedia/DM-WordPress-Layout) and uses the `DM_ENVIRONMENT` constant to determine the environment.

## Installation

Install via Composer (`composer require deliciousmedia/dm-ei`), or just clone/copy the file to your mu-plugins folder.
